    "Performing any in-depth analysis is challenging. So over the years, our team has introduced different teaching styles to smoothen the learning curve. This series of notebooks will help guide your team through the fundamentals of data science and will show you a prime example of an average analysis. We highly encourage everyone to read through the example and complete the workshops.\n",

    "Last week, you had a crash course in data analysis and learned statistical transformations.\n",
    "This week, you'll be introduced to applying these principles on a large set of data using R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start the fun stuff, let's review some vocabulary.\n",
    "I know, I know - _groan_ - but this stuff really comes in handy when you want to look things up or ask questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data* are values that describes something.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Information* is data that is useful - data is not meaningful. Information is.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Attributes* are the variables of your dataset. If you have a dataset that describes a windows, the attributes of the dataset could be, for example,  the dimensions of the window or the materials it is made from. Think of attributes as the headers of your dataset. In a dataframe, the values that describes the attributes are the data underneath the headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Features* are attributes that are useful. Attributes are not meaningful. Features are. The moment that an attribute tells us something about the dataset is the moment that it becomes a feature. Features are the useful bits of information that are fed into machine learning algorithms. Attributes can't be fed into machine learning algorithms because they don't tell the algorithm anything. It's just a jumble of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Feature Engineering* is the extraction of meaningful information out of attributes in our dataset. Think of it as turning attributes into features. An example of feature engineering is determining the day of the week given a date. We are creating a new feature (the day of the week) given an attribute (the date). Another example is extracting the surname out of a full name. This is considered feature engineering because surnames can identify people who are part of the same family in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our vocabulary refreshed, let's dive right in with an investigation of how R works.\n",
    "Write a number!"
