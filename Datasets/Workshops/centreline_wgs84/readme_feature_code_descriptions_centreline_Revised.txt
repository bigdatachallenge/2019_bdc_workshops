CENTRELINEINTRODUCTION

City of Toronto Centreline data comprises City of Toronto Centreline (TCL) medium scale digital mapping data. This includes the street fabric, rivers, highways, shorelines, trails, and utility corridors, all having names attached. The street layer also includes the address ranges of every street segment on both sides of the centreline.


DATA LIMITATIONS

TCL geography is represented at 2.5 meter or 8 foot positional accuracy. Large-scale representation of TCL data is not suitable for application projects required for utility and parcel mapping. The decisions drawn from this data must be acceptable as per 1:5,000 scale precision. It also should be noted that TCL database consists of mapping data within the jurisdiction of The City of Toronto. Mapping information from surrounding regions of Peel, Durham and York are not included in this database.


LINEAR FEATURE DEFINITION

Highway is designated for fast, long distance travel with restricted access to sustain high speeds. 

Highway Transfer Ramp provides for transfer between road and highway and also between highway and highway. 

Arterial Road is usually under regional jurisdiction and is fed by collector roads and in some cases is connected to other arterial roads or collector roads via Road Ramp. 

Collector Roads is designated mainly for travel to and from arterial roads with some driveway  access. In Metro they are usually under local jurisdiction.

Lane is designated mainly for City of Toronto laneways and are usually under local jurisdiction.

Local Road is designated to service driveway access and usually connects to collector roads or other local roads.

Access Road is dedicated to provide access to or within properties such as townhouse complexes, airports etc.

Pending Road is suggested to identify roads with a planned feature code that awaits Council Approval. This is not requested until the road is assumed and may be delayed for 6 years or more.

Road Ramps (major arterial,minor arterial, collector, other) provides for transfer between two roads.

Busway is a road dedicated for buses only.

Major Railway is designated for the fast, long distance, inter-provincial movement of cargo or passenger trains. 

Minor Railway is designated for local public transportation and includes above ground rapid transit corridors and subway lines.

River is a major waterway. 

Creek/Tributary is a minor waterway.

Trail is a pedestrian way designated for recreational purposes and can include foot-powered vehicles such as bikes or roller-blades etc. 

Walkway is a designated path primarily for walking.

Hydro Line is an electricity transportation corridor (high voltage).

Major Shoreline is a boundary of a large body of water. E.g. Lake Ontario shoreline. 

Minor Shoreline is a boundary of a small body or water such as a pond or reservoir.
